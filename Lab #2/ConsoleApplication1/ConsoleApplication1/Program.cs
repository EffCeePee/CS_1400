        //Here I will define variable names

        // 1. We are goign to figure out the shaded area that Farmer John would like to know from the Lab 2 Exercise
        // 2. We will ask Farmer John to provide us the radius of the circle
        // 3. We will save this in a variable named radius
        // 4. We will calculate the area of the square, given that the radius is half of the length and width of the square using
        //    the formula, Area of a Square = the length X the Width
        // 5. We will calculate the area of the irrigation circles that are inside the square, using the formula Area of a circle
        //    = Pi x Radius Squared
        // 6. We will then subtract the areas of the irrigation circles from the area of the square
        // 7. We will display the results
