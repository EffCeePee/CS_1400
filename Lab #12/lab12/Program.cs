class Program
{
// Declare Constants, in this case we have none
// Declare Variables, Side A, Side B, and Side C, repeat
// Start Main Method
// Begin main program Loop
// Tell the user that this program will compute the hypotenuse of a triangle.
// Gather the lenghts of the two known sides of the triangle, store them as variables
// Call Method "CalculateHypotenuse", and display the results stored in Side C
// Close main loop while: call method "Repeat."
// Start a new method "Calculate Hypotenuse"
// Purpose: Calculates the the hypotenuse of a triangle
// Parameters: Two Doubles, the known triangle side lengths
// Returns: A double, the hypotenuse
// The method header:  static double CalculateHypotenuse(double sideA, double sideB);
// Square Side A, store it as a variable double SideA
// Square Side B, store it as a variable double SideB
// Add Side A and Side B together store as variable Side C
// Square Root Side C, store it as variable Side C
// Return value to main method
// Start a new method "Repeat"
// Purpose: to determine if the user would like to calculate another hypotenuse
// Parameters: none
// Returns: a boolean = true for yes, and false for no
// The method header: static bool repeat()
// declare local variables, string yes, string no, string answer
// Begin validation loop
// Prompt user if they want to calculate a new hypotenuse
// If answer is not "yes" or "no" then ask for correct input
// else if answer is yes, then return true,
// else if answer is no, then return false
// end method repeat
// End Class Program
